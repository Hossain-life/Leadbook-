# Task summary

This is a readme file which describes the entire work of this project. At first, I imported the necessary packages to access the json content(if any) in the website, but I found out there was no content of json format. Then, I installed XMltodict package to scrap the website into html file format, and later on, I parsed and converted the html file into two seperate desired html format files using an online tool to convert into json files with the python packages called xmltojson and json. Subsequently, I installed pymysql to load the json files into MySQL, and in order to do so, I created a database with two tables needed for the json files, and also, I connected with the database from my local machine. One of the json_files relevant to company_profiles was nested, and I performed normalization on the data to flatten it. As my prime objective was to include the samples of all the features in the table, I used metadata to include all the samples in the remaining columns for the second json_file. I even displayed the results from the database to my local machine for both the tables in the database. Furthermore, I also performed two tests on the url with one of the json files using API and then validated data points by checking the response status code of a browser. At last, I explained in the python file why I used database engine called InnoDB.
